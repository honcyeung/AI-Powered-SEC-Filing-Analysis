The Company distinguishes between\ndigital assets which fall within the scope of ASC 350-60 and those which do not. The Company refers to digital assets which fall\nwithin the scope of ASC 350-60 (e.g., ETH) as “crypto assets.” Digital assets which do not fall within the scope of ASC\n350-60,\nAccounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets\n, are referred to as “digital intangible\nassets.”\nAs\nof June 30, 2025, the Company held $\n61.5\nmillion of crypto assets comprised of ETH that are in the scope of ASC 350-60 at fair value.\nThe Company reflects crypto assets held at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets within the Crypto assets\xa0line item.

The\nactivity from remeasurement of crypto assets at fair value is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations within Unrealized\nloss on crypto assets. Realized gains and losses from the derecognition of crypto assets are included in Realized gain on crypto assets,\nnet in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company uses a first-in, first-out methodology to assign costs to crypto assets\nfor purposes of the crypto assets held and realized gains and losses disclosures in Note 2, Digital Asset Holdings. S\nales and purchases of crypto assets are\nreflected as cash flows from investing activities in the\nconsolidated statements of cash flows.  Contributions of crypto assets received as part of the consideration received in the PIPE and deposits of ETH into liquid\nstaking protocol are presented as noncash investing and financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nAs\nof June 30, 2025, the Company held $\n382.4\nmillion of digital intangible assets comprised of LsETH that are intangible assets outside the scope of ASC 350-60. A receipt token, in general and by design, entitles the holder to redeem the crypto intangible asset(s) for which\nit was exchanged. Therefore, it fails the ‘other goods and services criterion’ in paragraph 350-60-15-1(b), and thus is outside\nthe scope of Subtopic 350-60.\nThese\ndigital intangible assets are recorded at cost, less impairment within digital intangible assets on the consolidated balance sheets in\naccordance with ASC 350-30. The Company tests digital intangible assets for impairment annually and more frequently if events or changes\nin circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired. The test for impairment consists of a comparison\nof the fair value of the digital intangible assets with their carrying amounts. Refer to\nNote 2, Digital Asset Holdings\n, for additional\ninformation.\nETH\nStaking\nBeginning\nin June 2025, the Company used the proceeds from its capital raising activities to acquire and deploy ETH in staking activities,\nwhich can include native staking, liquid staking and restaking. The Company has entered into separate contractual agreements with\nvarious third-party entities to facilitate its ETH staking\nactivities. The Company commenced both native staking and liquid\nstaking in June of 2025. The Company intends for staking to become a primary yield generation strategy of the Company within the\ncurrent fiscal year.\nNative\nStaking\nThe\nCompany utilized two third-party asset managers to manage and stake ETH on its behalf as of June 30, 2025. Through its agreements\nwith these asset managers, the Company’s ETH is held by qualified custodians, staked in the Ethereum protocol, and the stake is\ndelegated to third party validators. When chosen as validators by the Ethereum network, these validators earn staking rewards and transaction\nfees proportional to the amount of stake delegated to them. The Company recognizes rewards from native staking as revenue in accordance\nwith ASC 606. However,\xa0since the amount of rewards are not known by the Company until a validation activity is completed and the\nCompany receives rewards in their custodial account, the staking rewards are constrained under the Topic 606 guidance on variable\nconsideration, until such time.\nBecause\nthe Company is not the principal to the block validation service, it does not control the full output of the reward-generating activity,\nand instead receives net staking rewards, after validator commissions are deducted. As such, the Company presents staking revenue on\na net basis, reflecting only the portion of protocol rewards to which it is entitled. Asset manager fees\nare presented as separate operating expenses.\nLiquid\nStaking\nThe\nCompany participates in liquid staking, which is similar to native staking. One key difference and intended benefit of liquid staking\nis that it provides for liquidity by allowing the Company to earn staking rewards while still maintaining the ability, provided through\nthe receipt token, to enter into to other transactions. When the Company’s ETH is staked, the Company is provided with a digital\nintangible asset (i.e., LsETH)\xa0which represents the crypto asset (i.e., ETH) which has been staked. LsETH is a non-rebasing liquid\nstaking receipt token. It uses a floating redemption rate between LsETH and the underlying staked ETH. The redemption rate is determined\nby the underlying staked ETH and the current value of accumulated staking rewards, penalties, and fees associated with the underlying\nstaked ETH. As a result, staking rewards earned from the Company’s liquid staking activities are not recognized as revenue.\nThese staking rewards will be recognized as gains or losses upon redemption\nor sale of the LsETH in accordance with ASC 610-20\nOther Income - Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets\nas the Company is unable to determine the staking rewards to which is entitled at the time of the initial staking such that the staking\nrewards are constrained under the ASC 606 guidance on variable consideration which also applies to transfers of non-financial assets under\nASC 610-20.\xa0No LsETH was redeemed or sold in the quarter ended June 30, 2025.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn\ufeff\xa0November\n2024,\xa0the FASB issued ASU 2024-04,\nDebt - Debt with Conversions and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20): Induced Conversions\nof Convertible Debt Instruments\n(“ASU 2024-04”).\xa0ASU\xa02024-04\xa0is intended to clarify requirements for determining\nwhether certain settlements of convertible debt instruments, including convertible debt instruments with cash conversion features or\nconvertible debt instruments that are\xa0not\xa0currently convertible, should be accounted for as an induced conversion.

The discount for warrants, the Original Issuance Discount\n(“OID”) and the initial allocation of fair value of compound derivatives reduce the initial carrying amount of the convertible\nnotes. The carrying value is the stated principal amount at contractual maturity using the effective-interest method with a corresponding\ncharge to interest expense. Debt discounts are presented on the condensed consolidated\xa0balance sheets as a direct deduction from\nthe carrying amount of that related debt.\nThe\nCompany made an irrevocable election at the time of issuance of the Debenture to record the Debenture at its fair value (the “Fair\nValue Option”) with changes in fair value recorded through the Company’s condensed consolidated\xa0statements of operations\nwithin other income (expense) at each reporting period. The Fair Value Option provides the Company with a measurement basis election\nfor financial instruments on an instrument-by-instrument basis.\nOn\nFebruary 14, 2023, the Company entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”) with Alpha, a current\nshareholder of the Company, pursuant to which the Company issued to Alpha\xa0an\n8\n%\nInterest Rate,\n10\n%\nOriginal Issue Discount, Senior Convertible Debenture (the “Debenture”) in the aggregate principal amount of $\n4,400,000\nfor a purchase price of $\n4,000,000\non February 15, 2023. The Debenture is convertible, at any time, and from time to time, at Alpha’s option, into shares of\nCommon Stock of the Company (the “Conversion Shares”), at an initial conversion price equal to $\n84.00\nper\nshare, subject to adjustment as described in the debenture agreement. A\xa0registration statement on Form S-1 (File No.:\n333-271396) was filed with the SEC on April 21, 2023, and as a result, the reset price\xa0was set to\xa0$\n50.13\n.\n| 12 |\n| Table of Contents |\nPursuant\nto Section 8(a)(vi) of the Debenture, it is an event of default if the Company is party to a Fundamental Transaction or agrees to sell\nor dispose of all or in excess of\n33\n% of its assets in one transaction or a series of related transactions. On January 19, 2024, SharpLink\nand Alpha entered into a settlement agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) whereby Alpha agreed to waive (i) the event of\ndefault under Section 8(a)(vi) of the Debenture in connection with the Sale of Business; and (ii) payment of the Mandatory Default Amount;\nand the parties agreed that the Company would pay\n110\n% of the outstanding principal amount of the Debenture, plus accrued and unpaid\ninterest, in the aggregate total amount of $\n4,484,230\n(the “Debenture Redemption Amount”).\nOn\nJanuary 19, 2024, the Company paid Alpha the Debenture Redemption Amount. As a result, the Company’s obligations under the Debenture\nhave been satisfied.\nPurchase\nWarrant\nOn\nFebruary 15, 2023, the Company also issued to Alpha a warrant (the “Warrant”) to purchase\n73,333\ncommon shares of the Company\nat an initial exercise price of $\n105.01\n(the “Warrant Shares,” and, together with the Conversion Shares, and any other\ncommon shares of the Company that may otherwise become issuable pursuant to the terms of the Debenture and Warrant, the “Underlying\nShares”). The Warrant is exercisable in whole or in part, at any time on or after February 15, 2023 and before February 15, 2028.\nAt\nthe time of execution, the Company classified the Warrant as an equity contract and performed an initial fair value measurement. As the\nWarrant was issued with the assumption of the Debenture, the value assigned to the Warrant was based on an allocation of proceeds, subject\nto the allocation to the Debenture. The Company recorded a debt discount for the Warrant of $\n1,174,229\n, based on the Black Scholes option-pricing\nmodel which was calculated independently of the fair value of the Debenture, and recorded the Warrant as additional paid-in capital.\nThe\nWarrant provided that in the event of a Fundamental Transaction (as defined in the Debenture), SharpLink, at Alpha’s option, would\nrepurchase the Warrant from Alpha on the terms set forth in Section 3(e)(ii) of the 2023 Warrant (the “Warrant Repurchase”).\nOn January 19, 2024, SharpLink and Alpha entered into a settlement agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) whereby Alpha agreed\nto waive (i) the event of default under Section 3(e)(ii) of the Warrant in connection with the Sale of Business.\nPursuant\nto Section 5(1) of the Warrant, Alpha further agreed to waive its right to elect that, in connection with and at the closing of the Sale\nof Business, the Warrant shall be repurchased by the Company as set forth in Section 3(e) of the 2023 Warrant. The parties agreed in\nthe Settlement Agreement that the Warrant Repurchase for its Black Scholes value shall take place upon the earlier of (a) June 30, 2024;\n(b) the Company raising a gross amount of not less than $\n3,000,000\nwhether by equity or debt; and (c) the Company entering into a Fundamental\nTransaction\xa0as defined in the 2023 Warrant. The parties further agreed in the Settlement Agreement value of the 2023 Warrant for\npurposes of the Warrant Repurchase at $\n900,000\n, which was based on a Black Scholes model.\nOn\nMarch 6, 2024, SharpLink entered into an Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with Alpha to change the Warrant Repurchase\nof $\n900,000\n. Pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the Exchange Agreement, the Company agreed to exchange the 2023 Warrant\nto purchase\n73,333\nshares of common stock\xa0for (i)\n13,017\nshares of Common Stock (the “Shares”), (ii) a pre-funded warrant\nin the amount of\n39,130\nshares of Common Stock (the “Pre-Funded Warrant”) and (iii) the unexchanged balance of the 2023 Warrant\nRepurchase (the “Warrant Repurchase Balance”). The Warrant Repurchase Balance of\n21,186\nwarrants was valued at $\n170,636\nand\nshall be subject to the repurchase terms set forth in the Settlement Agreement. The Pre-Funded Warrant and the Warrant Repurchase Balance\nwere valued using Black Scholes option-pricing model.

The fair value of each warrant awarded for compensation is estimated on the date of grant using a Black\nScholes option-pricing model. The Company uses historical option exercise and termination data to estimate the term the options are\nexpected to be outstanding.

The Company has entered into separate contractual agreements with various\nthird-party entities to facilitate its ETH staking\nactivities. The Company commenced both native staking and liquid staking in\nJune of 2025. The Company intends for staking to become a primary revenue generation strategy of the Company within the current fiscal\nyear.\nNative Staking\nThe\nCompany utilized two third-party asset managers to manage and stake ETH on its behalf as of June 30, 2025.\nThrough\nits agreements with these asset managers, the Company’s ETH is held by qualified custodians, staked in the Ethereum protocol,\nand the stake is delegated to third party validators. When chosen as validators by the Ethereum network, these validators earn staking\nrewards and transaction fees proportional to the amount of stake delegated to them. The Company recognizes rewards from native staking\nas revenue in accordance with ASC 606.\nAll\nnative staking revenue is earned within the United States as the validators are domiciled within the United States.\nLiquid\nStaking\nThe\nCompany participates in liquid staking, which is similar to native staking. One key difference and intended benefit of liquid staking\nis that it provides for liquidity by allowing the Company to earn staking rewards while still maintaining the ability, provided through\nthe receipt token, to enter into to other transactions. When the Company’s ETH is staked, the Company is provided with a digital\nintangible asset (i.e., LsETH)\xa0which represents the crypto asset (i.e., ETH) which has been staked. Liquid\xa0staking rewards\nwill be recognized as gains or losses within other income upon redemption or sale of the LsETH in accordance with ASC 610-20. No LsETH\nwas redeemed or sold in the period ended June 30, 2025.\nThe\nCODM assesses financial performance based on consolidated revenue, operating profit and key operating expenses as detailed below.\n| 18 |\n| Table of Contents |\nThe\nfollowing table presents significant segment expenses regularly provided to and reviewed by the CODM for the ETH Staking segment:\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  | ETH Staking Segment |  |\n|  |  |  | For theThreeMonthsEnded June30, 2025 |  |  |  | For the SixMonthsEnded June30, 2025 |  |\n| Revenue |  | $ | 28,534 |  |  | $ | 28,534 |  |\n| Segment gross profit |  |  | 28,534 |  |  |  | 28,534 |  |\n| Less: |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Salaries and benefits |  |  | 118,961 |  |  |  | 118,961 |  |\n| Contractors and consulting expense |  |  | 43,511 |  |  |  | 43,511 |  |\n| Asset manager fees |  |  | 377,841 |  |  |  | 377,841 |  |\n| Legal expenses |  |  | 83,145 |  |  |  | 83,145 |  |\n| Realized gains on crypto assets, net |  |  | (5,373,583 | ) |  |  | (5,373,583 | ) |\n| Unrealized loss on crypto assets |  |  | 2,437,026 |  |  |  | 2,437,026 |  |\n| Impairment on digital intangible assets |  |  | 87,813,295 |  |  |  | 87,813,295 |  |\n| Other segment expenses(1) |  |  | 16,379,368 |  |  |  | 16,379,368 |  |\n| Segment net loss from continuing operations before income taxes |  |  | (101,851,030 | ) |  |  | (101,851,030 | ) |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Reconciliation of profit or loss |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Adjustments and reconciling items |  |  | - |  |  |  | - |  |\n| Consolidated net loss from continuing operations before income taxes |  |  | (101,851,030 | ) |  |  | (101,851,030 | ) |\n| (1) |  | -                                            other segment items included in Segment net loss include: stock-based compensation - related                                            party. |\nThese\nexpenses represent the key cost components reviewed by the CODM in assessing the Company’s performance.\nThe\nCODM evaluates income generated from the Company’s assets using net income (loss) as a key metric.

The Company is currently engaged\nin the provision of Affiliate Marketing services and Ethereum Staking activities.\nThe\nCompany’s assets and liabilities related to its contracts with customers were as follows:\nSchedule\nof Contract Assets and Liabilities\n|  |  | June 30, 2025 |  |  | December 31, 2024 |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Accounts receivable |  | $ | 271,905 |  |  | $ | 264,831 |  |\nAffiliate\nMarketing\nThe\ntiming of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers and these timing differences result in contract advanced\nbillings on the Company’s condensed\xa0consolidated balance sheet. The Company recognized unbilled revenue when revenue is recognized\nprior to invoicing.\nPayment\nterms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 days. In instances where\nthe timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, the Company has determined that its contracts generally do not\ninclude a significant financing component. The primary purpose of invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable\nways of purchasing the Company’s services, and not to facilitate financing arrangements.\nETH\nStaking\nIn\nnative staking, the Company retains the right and ability to direct the use of the underlying ETH, subject to a bonding period. As such,\nthe Company does not derecognize the ETH when participating in native staking. The Company recognizes rewards from native staking as\nrevenue in accordance with ASC 606. The Company acts as an agent in native staking transactions as it delegates ETH to third-party validator\noperators who perform the technical validation responsibilities. Native staking rewards are recognized as revenue at the end of each\nepoch, or block processing time, or when earned and measurable and when the Company’s share of rewards is known. The amount of revenue\nrecognized is measured at fair value and is presented net of validator or other protocol fees.\nThe\nCompany also participates in liquid staking, which is similar to native staking; however, one key difference and intended benefit of\nthis method is the ability to provide the Company with tokens representing digital assets in exchange for its ETH. Liquid staking\nrewards are accumulated through the protocol conversion rate for the LsETH and will be recognized as gains or losses within other\nincome upon redemption or sale of the LsETH in accordance with ASC 610-20. No LsETH was redeemed or sold in the period ended June\n30, 2025.\nAs\nof Jun\ufeffe 30, 2025, the Company had native staked\n23,200\nETH on the Ethereum blockchain. For the period ended June 30, 2025, the Company earned\n11.5\nETH and recognized revenue from native staking rewards of\n$\n28,534\n.\n| 20 |\n| Table of Contents |\nNote\n10\n–\nIncome Taxes\nOn\na quarterly basis, we estimate our annual effective tax rate and record a quarterly income tax provision based on the anticipated rate.\nAs the year progresses, we refine our estimate based on the facts and circumstances, including discrete events, by each tax jurisdiction.\nThe effective tax rate for the six-month ended\xa0June 30, 2025 was (\n0.0\n%). The Company has NOLs available to offset 80% of the current\nyear taxable income and the gain, net of tax is classified as discontinued operations in the financial statements.\xa0The Company is\nin the process of dissolving certain legal entities to simplify its legal structure. The tax impact of these legal entities being dissolved\nis not expected to be significant. The launch of the treasury reserve strategy during the second quarter of 2025 increased the Company’s deferred tax\nasset by approximately $\n20\nmillion for a deferred tax asset of approximately $\n27\nmillion for the period ended June 30, 2025. The Company\nhas a full valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets as of the period ended\xa0June 30, 2025\nWe\nfollow the authoritative guidance on accounting for and disclosure of uncertainty in tax positions which requires us to determine whether\na tax position of the Company is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals of\nlitigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. For tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold, the\nuncertain tax benefit amount recognized in the financial statements is reduced to the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood\nof being realized upon the ultimate settlement with the relevant taxing authority. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions\nare included in the provision for income taxes in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. In accordance with the Sale of\nBusiness (\nSee Note 3\n), management performed an evaluation of the technical merits of the Israeli Controlled Foreign Corporate\nRules to determine the taxability of the gain from the Sale of Business from an Israeli tax perspective. This analysis also considered\nthe results of the U.S. income tax. Management determined that the technical merits for uncertain tax exposure resulting from the gain\nfor Israeli tax purposes did not exceed the more-likely-than-not threshold and has not recorded any income tax liability at June 30,\n2025. Management’s determination is based on known facts and circumstances and requires judgment of a complex set of rules and\nregulations. If facts and circumstances change, such as closing, liquidating or selling of the businesses’ equity that is remaining,\nincluding events outside the Company’s control, this could have a material impact on the management’s determination.\nOn July 4, 2025, subsequent to the end of the reporting\nperiod, the U.S. federal government enacted the\nOne Big Beautiful Bill Act (“OBBBA”)\n, which includes significant amendments\nto the Internal Revenue Code. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the legislation on its consolidated financial statements,\nincluding deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nNote\n11\n–\nNet Income (Loss) Per Share\nBasic\nnet income (loss) per share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders, adjusted for preferred stock\ndiscount accretion and dividends accrued on preferred stock, by the weighted-average number of common stock outstanding during the period\nexcluding the effects of any potentially dilutive securities. Diluted net loss per share is computed similar to basic loss per share,\nexcept that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common stock that would have been outstanding if potential\nshares of common stock had been issued if such additional common stock were dilutive.\nAs\nthe Company had a net loss from continuing operations and net income from\xa0discontinued operations for the three and six months ended\nJune 30, 2024, the following presents dilutive and anti-dilutive securities.\nFor\ncontinuing operations, since there was a net loss, all securities presented below were excluded from weighted average shares outstanding.\nFor discontinued operations, dilutive securities presented below were included in the net income per share calculation and the anti-dilutive\nsecurities were excluded in weighted average shares outstanding:\nSchedule of Computation of Diluted Shares Outstanding\n|  |  | Three MonthsEnded June 30,2025 |  |  | Six MonthsEnded June 30,2025 |  |\n| Dilutive: |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Prefunded warrants |  |  | 11,897,165 |  |  |  | 11,817,165 |  |\n| Regular warrants |  |  | 6,219,032 |  |  |  | 6,219,032 |  |\n| Restricted Stock Units |  |  | 4,167 |  |  |  | 4,167 |  |\n| Total Dilutive |  |  | 18,120,364 |  |  |  | 18,040,364 |  |\n| Anti-Dilutive: |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Stock options |  |  | 9,022 |  |  |  | 9,022 |  |\n| SportsHub warrants |  |  | 252 |  |  |  | 252 |  |\n| Total Anti-dilutive |  |  | 9,274 |  |  |  | 9,274 |  |\nAs\nthe Company had a net loss from continuing operations and net income from discontinued operations for the three months ended March 31,\n2024, the following presents dilutive and anti-dilutive securities.
